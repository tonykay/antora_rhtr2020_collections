*Visual Studio Code* is entirely optional for this lab.
It is actually running on the `control` node, as the `devops` user and offers both local file editing and direct terminal access to `control`.
The *primary* use cases is for those of you who prefer a more fully featured editor than `vim` or perhaps prefer not to work with Windows `ssh` clients.

Feel free to *bypass* this optional section.

[TIP] 
====
If you enjoy a full featured editor for Ansible and many other platforms and languages then *VSC* (Visual Studio Code) has excellent support.
This lab was written in a mixture of `vim` and *VSC*.

VSC is a free download and can be both local i.e. on your laptop with a remote development option over `ssh` and also can be served as in our case where it runs on `control`.

The curious can see how it was configured for this lab link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/tree/development/ansible/roles/vscode-server[here]
