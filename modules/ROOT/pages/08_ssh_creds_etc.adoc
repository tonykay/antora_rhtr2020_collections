In case you get logged out, forget where your credentials are etc, here is everything you need for access.


=== Access Options for your Control Node

As mentioned in the introduction you have a number of ways to access your control node.
The entire lab can be completed, and verified, from the command line, however Ansible Tower credentials will be supplied.

. `ssh` directly from the terminal session in your browser
. `ssh` directly from your laptop
. Use Visual Studio Code as outlined in the next Section

==== Use SSH to remotely connect to the lab control host


. Either in the terminal session in your browser or from your laptop `ssh` to `control`.
+

Your `ssh` password is *{SSH_PASSWORD}*
+

[source,bash,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
$ {SSH_COMMAND} 
----
+

. Become the `devops` Service Account User with `sudo`
+

The `devops` user has password-less sudo access and fully configured ssh access to all other systems in the lab environment.

. After successfully logging in to the control node, become the `devops` user:
+

[source,bash,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
[student@control 0 ~]$ sudo su - devops
----

=== Access Visual Studio Code

. Access link:`{VSCODE_UI_URL}[Visual Studio Code], password *{VSCODE_UI_PASSWORD}* when prompted.
+
You are already logged in as the `devops` Service Account with Visual Studio Code
