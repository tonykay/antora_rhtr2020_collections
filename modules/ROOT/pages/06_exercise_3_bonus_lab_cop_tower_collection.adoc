The Red Hat *Automation Community of Practice* has created its own collection `redhat_cop.tower_configuration` that builds on, and extends, `awx.awx`.


* Explore the collection online: link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/tower_configuration[`redhat_cop.tower_configuration`]
** Pay particular attention to the link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/tower_configuration/tree/devel/roles[`roles`] directory
** Take a look at a role in more detail e.g. link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/tower_configuration/blob/devel/roles/users/tasks/main.yml[users]
** Explore how it specifies its link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/tower_configuration/blob/devel/galaxy.yml.j2[dependency] on the awx.awx` collection 

Finally write a playbook that uses this collection:

* Perhaps add several new users to Ansible Tower
* Alternatively your earlier `awx.awx` lab deployed an application, the same repository contains a link:https://github.com/tonykay/solution_ansible_flask_app_loader_all_in_one/blob/main/teardown-app.yml[teardown] playbook
** Using `redhat_cop.tower_configuration` create a new `job_template` and launch with the `awx` cli (refer to Exercise 2.2 and 2.3 if necessary)
