The lab takes place on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux infrastructure.
You will work from a Control Node `control` and use a collection to configure an Ansible Tower server to deploy your application.

[options=header,cols="2,3"]
|====
|Host Name |Description
|`control.{GUID}.{OSP_DOMAIN}`  | Ansible Control Node with `ssh` access
|`tower.{GUID}.{OSP_DOMAIN}`    | Ansible Tower Server
|`frontend1.{GUID}.{OSP_DOMAIN}`| Exposed instance for HAProxy Load Balancer
|`app1.example.com`             | Internal App Server for Python/Flask API and Web Site
|`app2.example.com`             | Internal App Server for Python/Flask API and Web Site
|`appdb1.example.com`           | Internal Postgresql Server

[NOTE]
====
For the curious this configuration is running on a Red Hat OpenStack Cluster hosted on an IBM bare metal cloud infrastructure.
The terminal session you see to the right is a container (Pod) running on a Red Hat OpenShift Cluster - it is *not* your
*Control Node*.

====

=== Lab Goals

Whilst you will deploy a multi-tier application onto this infrastructure, that component is secondary to learning to work with collections.
During the course of the lab you will:

* Learn how to use collections within your playbooks
* Learn how to install, and explore, collections
* Learn how to create, and then use, a simple collection
* Use the `awx.awx` collection to configure Ansible Tower

In addition *Bonus Labs* outline further Collections based challenges.

=== Access Options for your Control Node

As mentioned in the introduction you have a number of ways to access your control node.
The entire lab can be completed, and verified, from the command line, however Ansible Tower credentials will be supplied.

. `ssh` directly from the terminal session in your browser
. `ssh` directly from your laptop
. Use Visual Studio Code as outlined in the next Section

==== Use SSH to remotely connect to the lab control host


. Either in the terminal session in your browser or from your laptop `ssh` to `control`.
+

Your `ssh` password is *{SSH_PASSWORD}*
+

[source,bash,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
$ {SSH_COMMAND} 
----
+

. Become the `devops` Service Account User with `sudo`
+

The `devops` user has password-less sudo access and fully configured ssh access to all other systems in the lab environment.

. After successfully logging in to the control node, become the `devops` user:
+

[source,bash,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
$ sudo su - devops
----

=== Working with your Infrastructure

The entire lab can be completed solely from the command line and the terminal you can see in your browser can ssh directly to your control node.
You can also ssh directly from your laptop with the command.

In addition there is the *option* to connect via a browser to a Visual Studio Code server running on your control node giving both remote editing capability and an in-built terminal running on `control`.

In the next section you will review, and access, your environment.
